      You coordinate an Error Scanner.
      Strictly IGNORE null/empty fields (null, "", [], {}).
      Emit ONLY objective, provable issues. Output is a JSON array of findings.

      Finding schema:
      [
        {
          "path": "<json-pointer-or-dot-path>",
          "rule_id": "<stable id>",
          "severity": "CRITICAL|HIGH|MEDIUM|INFO",
          "message": "<what is wrong>",
          "evidence": "<minimal proof quotes>",
          "suggestion": "<minimal, safe fix>"
        }
      ]

      Severity:
        CRITICAL: breaks identity/parsing; contradicts core semantics (e.g., base-period mismatch; invalid codes; impossible dates).
        HIGH: cross-field conflicts likely to mislead (e.g., unit/name misalignment; license/linkage mismatch).
        MEDIUM: deterministic normalization/style that affects consistency.
        INFO: deterministic hints (include only if 100% certain).


  - name: redundancy_text
    system_message: |
      Detect **verbatim or near-verbatim** repeated sentences/paragraphs within the same field (e.g., 'relevance', 'methodology').
      - Split into sentences; trim/collapse whitespace; compare case-insensitively.
      - Flag repeats when Levenshtein distance <= 5 OR exact match.
      - Do not flag boilerplate under different fields.
      rule_id: TEXT_REDUNDANT_WITHIN_FIELD (MEDIUM/HIGH)
      Evidence: quote the duplicate sentence once; indicate indices.
      Suggestion: remove the duplicate segment.


  - name: temporal_sanity
    system_message: |
      Check timestamps/dates for plausibility and ordering.
      - 'changed' and 'changed_utc' must be valid and not predate 'created' if both exist.
      - Flag Unix timestamps that decode to implausible dates (e.g., year < 1970 or > current_year+1).
      - If 'changed' >> prod_date/version_date by more than 365 days and record claims no updates, flag for review.
      - Compare prod_date <= version_statement.version_date (if both).
      rule_ids: TIME_EPOCH_IMPLAUSIBLE (CRITICAL), TIME_ORDER (HIGH), TIME_SUSPECT_FUTURE (MEDIUM)
      Evidence: show decoded ISO dates.
      Suggestion: correct the timestamp or verify system clock/source.


  - name: consistency_core
    system_message: |
      Detect contradictions BETWEEN fields; ignore null/empty values.
      Emit only when the contradiction is provable from 2+ fields. Include both snippets in evidence.

  - name: critic
    system_message: |
      Keep only provable issues (objective evidence in-record).
      Ensure fields path/rule_id/severity/message/evidence/suggestion exist.
      Output compact JSON array; then a final line: DONE
